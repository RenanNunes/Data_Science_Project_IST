# Description

Project to apply different data science techniques (since data preparation until some emsemble models) and analyze its results and impacts in two distinct datasets.

The first dataset is related with parkinson disease prediction with speech features and the second with forest covertype prediction with some geographic and geological information.

Some examples of techniques applied are: normalization, balancing dataset, feature ranking. And some models: Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost.

There is also a report regarding the results, but it's presented only in Portuguese.
